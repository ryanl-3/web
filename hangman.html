  <h2>Project Description</h2>
  
  <p>Welcome to Hangman. Users will interact with the computer through the shell.<a href="https://ryanl-3.github.io/web/hangmancode.html">This link will take you to a plain text file where you can copy and paste the code into thonny.</a> Do not forget to have the word bank down below under Resources saved as a txt file named word_bank.</p>
  
  <h2>Instructions</h2>
  
  <p>How to play: You will be asked if you are ready to start by typing "yes" or "no" into the shell. Once you type "yes", "_"  's will show up, each blank representing the number of hidden letters the word still contains. Here, you will start playing. Each turn, you will either guess a letter or the entire word if you believe you know what the mystery word is. Remember to logically make your guesses because there is a certain number of lives you have. Every time you choose a letter, and it isn't doesn't appear above the "_," you will lose a life. You may ask for a hint once you are down to three lives. You will have a maximum of seven lives.  Each time a life is lost, the computer displays an image of a hangman in the shell. This image indicates the number of lives the player has left. The game will end with you guessing the word correctly or when you lose all your lives.
</p>
  
  <h2>How it works</h2>
  
  <p>A word bank consisting of 10,000 words is attained, which is used to select the word randomly. The code opens, reads, and modifies the word file (functions in the beginning do this). This includes removing words from the word file that are less than four letters long. The contents of this file are then sorted into a list, and after,  alphabetically into a dictionary, and words that are less than three letters long are removed. The computer randomly selects a letter, and randomly selects a word from the dictionary (key value pair; key = letter, value = list of words that start with the key letter). This is done by import random, and calling random.choice. The code then contains a series of booleans that evaluate the user’s input and returns a specific response. Towards the end, the code has several more booleans, which are responsible for displaying hints for the user, and printing the correct response. Throughout the code, there are several win/loss conditions that activate when the user guesses the correct word or runs out of lives. A ‘break’ cuts out of the loop, and restarts the game </p>
  <p>We searched online for a long list of words that the computer can randomly generate for this game. The contents of this file are sorted alphabetically into a  dictionary, and words that are less than three letters long are removed. Once the user is ready to begin, the user randomly picks a letter.  It then accesses the dictionary key of that letter (which is a list) and randomly selects a word for the user to guess. The computer will output _ to indicate the unknown letters.

  <h2>Bugs, Errors and Things to be Aware of</h2>
  
  <ul>
    <li id="l">Whenever you inter an invalid response more than twice for a hint, it will skip the hint.</li>
    <li id="l">If you lose the game the shell will still ask you to guess a letter.</li>

  <p>The graph for the Hangman game shows how many letters the word contained and how many times I got that word. I played 30 times, and those were the results I received. The x-axis depicts the number of letters the word contains. The y-axis depicts the frequency of that word.</p>
