  <p>Vladimir Kramnik, (born June 25, 1975, Tuapse, Russia, U.S.S.R.), Russian international chess grandmaster who defeated his countryman Garry Kasparov to win the Professional Chess Association world championship. The match was held in London from October 8 to November 2, 2000, with Kramnik winning 2 games, drawing 13, and losing none.
  Kramnik had good success in junior tournaments during his early years, winning the World Under 18 Championship in 1991. However, the first big break of his chess career came in 1992, and the man who gave it to him was Kasparov. With the breakup of the Soviet Union, Russia looked to have a real contest for the first time in decades at the upcoming Chess Olympiad. Kasparov led the team, but he shocked the Russian chess establishment by insisting that the 16-year-old Kramnik be allowed to play. (The Men’s Olympiad traditionally consists of a series of national matches between four of each nation’s six available players. At the time, Kramnik had not even earned the grandmaster title, and Russia had dozens of grandmasters.) Nevertheless, the weight of the world champion’s opinion was such that Kramnik was included on the team. Kramnik justified his inclusion by scoring a stunning eight wins and one draw out of nine games. The Russian team swept to victory once again, and Kramnik won an individual gold medal for best score, which was awarded to him on his 17th birthday.
  Following negotiations with the Fédération Internationale des Échecs (FIDE; the international chess federation), which recognized Kramnik as the “classical” world chess champion, he agreed to a unification match in 2006 with FIDE’s challenger, the Bulgarian grandmaster Veselin Topalov, who had won the 2005 FIDE World Championship Tournament. Kramnik earned the match victory with five wins, seven draws, and four losses, with one of the losses by way of a forfeit during an acrimonious dispute, known as “toilet gate,” over unsubstantiated accusations that he was somehow cheating during his very frequent visits to one of the player’s restrooms. As part of the unification contract, the winner agreed to risk the consolidated title in FIDE’s 2007 World Championship Tournament. Topalov and several other top grandmasters who had not previously qualified for this tournament were excluded from participating, which caused considerable animosity in the chess community. In addition, some individuals were incensed that Kramnik was guaranteed a title rematch should he not win the tournament. Viswanathan Anand of India, a former FIDE champion and perennial challenger for the top chess rating, won the tournament and defended the title against Kramnik in a 12-game match scheduled from October 14 to November 2, 2008, in Bonn, Germany. The match ended October 29, 2008, as the players drew the 11th game to give Anand the victory with a score of 3 wins, 7 draws, and 1 loss.</p>
