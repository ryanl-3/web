<p>The history of chess can be traced back nearly 1500 years, although the earliest origins are uncertain. Chess is a board game for two players. It is played on a square board, made of 64 smaller squares, with eight squares on each side. Each player starts with sixteen pieces: eight pawns, two knights, two bishops, two rooks, one queen and one king. Currently, in the past few years, there have been a few prestigeous and world renoun players from all over the world. Here is some information of their careers and achievements with chess.</p>
