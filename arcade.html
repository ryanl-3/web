  <p>Welcome to the Arcade!</p>

    <p>This website was designed and programmed by Ryan Lee, Sebastian Ching, and Justin Li. You can access the three different games that we coded in the header tab at the top of the screen. Clicking on each of these tabs will bring you to a page that contains an image of the game, a description of the game, and graphs indicating statistics for each game. We have three classic games which are Hangman, Number Guessing, and Rock Paper Scissors.</p>
