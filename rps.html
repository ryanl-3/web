  <h2>Project Description</h2>
  
  <p>Welcome to Rock Paper Scissors this is a single player game. Users interact with the computer through the shell.<a href="https://ryanl-3.github.io/web/rpscode.html">This link will take you to a plain text file where you can copy and paste the code into thonny.</a></p>
  
  <h2>Instructions</h2>
  
  <p>How to play: If you’ve been living under a rock, this is how you play rock paper scissors. You will type rock, paper, or scissors in the shell, and the computer will respond with its own choice. Rock beats scissor, paper beats rock, and scissor beats paper. If you and the computer play the same action, you both tie. Examples of this are if you throw down a rock and the computer throws down a scissor, you win, or if you throw down a rock and the computer throws down a rock as well, it is a tie. As you play more rounds, your score and the computer’s score will increase depending on how many matches you each won. After you enter your choice, the following will be displayed if you won or lost, your score, and the computer’s score.</p>
  
  <h2>How it works</h2>

  <p>Random is imported so that the computer can select between rock, paper, or scissor randomly. At the top of the code, two variables are created, which keep track of the scores. The game code is placed inside an infinite loop (while True) that prints out the computer/user score and wins. The computer then chooses from the three possible actions in a list and asks the user to input their choice. After that, a statement is displayed based on who wins. A series of booleans determine this.</p>

  <p>The graph for the Rock, Paper, Scissors shows which action I played and how many times I won with that action. I played 30 times, randomizing which action I chose. The y-axis represents how many times I won. The x-axis represents which action is being displayed.</p>
