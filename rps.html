  <h2>Project Description</h2>
  <p>This is a single player Rock Paper Scissors game. Users interact with the shell.</p>
  <h2>Insturctions</h2>
  <p>Welcome to Rock Paper Scissors, if you’ve been living under a rock this is how you play rock paper scissors. You and your opponent each throw down either rock, paper, or scissor, whatever time you agree on. If you throw down a rock and your opponent throws down a scissor, you win. Rock beats scissor, paper beats rock, and scissor beats paper. If you and your opponent play the same action, you tie. You will go against the computer, in the shell you may type in any of the three choices. After you press “enter”, the following will be displayed; win/lose, user score, and computer score.</p>
